# xrelease

xrelease (pronounced cross-release) helps you setup automated releases for your project for any language. No matter what programming language or framework you use, xrelease provides a standardized way to manage your release process.

## Why xrelease?

- üåç **Language Agnostic**: Works with any programming language or framework
- ü§ñ **Automated Workflow**: Standardized release process that just works
- üîÑ **Consistent Experience**: Same release workflow across all your projects
- üì¶ **Zero Config**: Sensible defaults with optional customization
- üîå **Extensible**: Adapt to your project's specific needs

## Quickstart Guide

### 1. Installation

Choose one of the following installation methods:

#### Option A: From npm registry (recommended)

```bash
npm install -g xrelease
```

#### Option B: From GitHub

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/xrelease.git
cd xrelease

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Make the CLI executable
chmod +x dist/cli/index.js

# Create a global symlink
npm link

# Verify installation
xrelease --help
```

#### Option C: As a local project dependency

```bash
# Clone and build first
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/xrelease.git
cd xrelease
npm install
npm run build
chmod +x dist/cli/index.js

# Then in your project's package.json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "xrelease": "file:../path/to/xrelease"
  }
}

# Install in your project
npm install
```

### 2. Setup in Your Project

1. Navigate to your project root:

```bash
cd your-project
```

2. Initialize xrelease:

```bash
xrelease init
```

This will create a `.xrelease.yml` configuration file in your project root.

3. Set up conventional commits (optional but recommended):

```bash
# Install necessary dependencies
npm install --save-dev @commitlint/cli @commitlint/config-conventional husky

# Initialize husky
npx husky install

# Add commit-msg hook for commitlint
npx husky add .husky/commit-msg 'npx --no -- commitlint --edit "$1"'

# Create commitlint config file
echo "module.exports = {extends: ['@commitlint/config-conventional']}" > commitlint.config.js
```

This setup will enforce conventional commit messages with the following format:

```
type(scope): subject

[optional body]
[optional footer(s)]
```

Valid types:

- feat: A new feature
- fix: A bug fix
- docs: Documentation changes
- style: Code style changes (formatting, etc)
- refactor: Code refactoring
- test: Adding or modifying tests
- chore: Maintenance tasks

Example commit messages:

```
feat(auth): add OAuth2 support
fix(api): handle null response from endpoint
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

### 3. Configuration

Edit `.xrelease.yml` to match your project needs:

```yaml
version: 1
release:
  # Branch to create releases from
  branch: main

  # Version bump type (major, minor, patch)
  defaultBump: patch

  # Changelog configuration
  changelog:
    enabled: true
    template: conventional

  # Pre-release checks
  checks:
    - type: lint
    - type: test
    - type: build

  # Post-release actions
  actions:
    - type: git-tag
    - type: github-release
```

### 4. Creating a Release

To create a new release:

```bash
xrelease create
```

This will:

1. Run pre-release checks
2. Bump version according to conventional commits
3. Generate changelog
4. Create git tag
5. Push release to GitHub (if configured)

### 5. Common Commands

```bash
# View current version
xrelease version

# Preview next release
xrelease preview

# Create release with specific bump
xrelease create --bump minor

# View release history
xrelease history
```

### 6. CI/CD Integration

Add to your CI pipeline:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Create Release
    run: |
      npm install -g xrelease
      xrelease create --ci
```

## Origin Story

As someone who builds in Python, Golang, Scala, Node.js, Swift, and more, I got tired of each ecosystem's quirky way of handling releases. Python has its poetry/twine dance, Scala has sbt-release (when it works), Node.js has semantic-release, and don't get me started on manually updating Swift package manifests. I just wanted one consistent way to handle this across all my projects - so I built xrelease to scratch my own itch.

## A Note for Scala Developers

Yes, xrelease is built with Node.js, not "sleek, performant, low-overhead Scala code with higher-order functions that will run on anything. Period. End of sentence." üòâ But here's the thing: release automation is fundamentally about file manipulation, git operations, and API calls. Node.js is perfect for this kind of task, and the CLI tool has zero impact on your production code or runtime performance. Think of it like using `sbt` or `mill` - these are build tools that happens to be written in Scala, but you use it for Java projects too, right?
